		other individuals outside of the Oops platform. When using the features
		of the App and the Site you are subject to these Terms as well as any
		other applicable agreements, policies or guidelines applicable to such
		features that may be posted from time to time, including the

		ACT AND THING REQUISITE AND NECESSARY TO BE DONE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH
		ACTIVITIES, AS YOU COULD DO IN PERSON. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT

		SOURCES, OOPS IS ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT AS THE AGENT OF OR ON
		BEHALF OF ANY THIRD PARTY. YOU AGREE THAT THIRD-PARTY DATA SOURCES WILL
		BE ENTITLED TO RELY ON THE FOREGOING AUTHORIZATION, AGENCY AND POWER OF

		account or a block from the Services, the App and Site.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>ACCOUNTS</strong><br />
		You may sign up for an account through the App or on the Site. Signing
		up for an account is free; however, we may also offer various paid
		subscriptions, premium access or fee-based services. We reserve the
		right to terminate any accounts that have been inactive for over 6
		months. Furthermore, we reserve the right to determine whether or not to
		approve your proposed account based on our discretion.
	</p>
	<p>
		As part of the account set up process, we will ask you for your
		information, including phone number, username and email address. You
		agree to provide us with accurate, true, and complete information.
		Should your information change, you agree to keep it up-to-date.
	</p>
	<p>
		You agree to choose a strong and secure password(s) and maintain the
		confidentiality of your password(s), including any password of a
		third-party site that we may allow you to use to access the App or the
		Site. Should you believe your password or security for the App or the
		Site has been breached in any way, you must immediately notify us at
		hi@oops.finance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oops or our billing processors collect your billing information if and
		when you upgrade to a paid account or access any fee-based services. All
		information is protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND SUBSCRIPTION FEES</strong><br />
		Oops may offer a free trial period during which you can use the Services
		for a limited period of time at no cost. You can manage or cancel the
		trial subscription through your app store account or otherwise via any
		methods described in the Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you subscribe to any paid subscriptions, you agree to pay all
		applicable fees related to such subscriptions. By providing a payment
		method, you expressly authorize us to charge the applicable fees on said
		payment method as well as taxes and other charges incurred thereto at
		regular intervals, all of which depend on your particular subscription
		and utilized Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		The subscription period for paid accounts can be month-to-month, yearly,
		or another duration described more fully on the Site and the App.
	</p>
	<p>
		Paid accounts are subject to fees based upon the account type you have
		selected. All subscriptions will automatically renew unless they are
		cancelled through your app store account or otherwise as specified in
		these Terms. For such renewals, Oops will automatically charge your
		payment method in the amount of the then-current fee for your type of
		account, plus applicable taxes. All payments are non-refundable. To the
		extent that payment mechanisms are provided through third parties, you
		agree that Oops will have no liability to you arising out of the acts or
		omissions of such third parties. If applicable, you agree to maintain
		current billing information.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we may give you
		advance notice of the fee changes.
	</p>
	<p>
		BY CREATING A PAID ACCOUNT, YOU CONSENT TO ALLOW OOPS TO CHARGE YOUR
		PAYMENT METHOD, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ITS PAYMENT PROCESSORS, FOR
		THE AMOUNTS DUE FOR YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND FOR ADDITIONAL
		SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS UNTIL YOUR ACCOUNT IS CANCELED OR TERMINATED.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>RENEWAL/CANCELLATION</strong><br />
		If Oops chooses to use paid accounts in the future, those accounts may
		automatically renew for the same subscription period unless you cancel
		the account by the end of the then-current subscription period by
		modifying your subscription preferences in your app store account. Any
		paid subscriptions that are purchased through an app store will be
		managed directly by the app store (e.g., Apple), and Oops will not be
		able to handle modifications or cancellations of those accounts. You
		will be able to manage the subscription on your mobile device through
		the appropriate account settings.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also cancel your account at any time by contacting customer
		service at hi@oops.finance. It may take up to five business days for the
		update or cancellation to take effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that after you cancel your account via any method, you may
		not be able to use or access the platform or our Services and you will
		not be entitled to a refund of any fees that you have already paid.
	</p>
	<p>

		statutes, ordinances, and regulations regarding your use of our
		Services, the App and the Site. Oops reserves the right to investigate
		complaints or reported violations of our Terms and to take any action we
		deem appropriate, including but not limited to canceling your User
		account, reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement
		officials, regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any
		information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities
		relating to your profile, e-mail addresses, usage history, posted
		materials, IP addresses, and traffic information, as allowed under our
		<a href="http://www.oops.finance/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. You agree

		unauthorized or illegal use of the Services, the App or the Site.

		requirement under the Hague Convention or other judicial treaty
		requiring that legal process be translated into any language other than

	</p>
	<p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>
	<p>
		We know that things don’t always go as planned. In the event of any
		claim, action, controversy, or dispute relating to the App, the Site,
		Service, these Terms, or any other dispute between you and Oops
		(“Dispute”), you and Oops agree to use the following dispute resolution
		procedure before filing a claim or initiating arbitration:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The party asserting the Dispute shall provide a written notice
			describing the facts, circumstances, and any other relevant
			information to the other party (Notice).
		</li>
		<li>The notice shall be sent by registered or first class mail.</li>
		<li>
			The receiving party will be allowed 30 calendar days to respond to (or
			resolve) the
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Dispute.</p>
		<p>Addresses:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			If the receiving party is Oops, the Notice shall be sent to the
			following address: 217 Thompson Street, New York, NY, 10012.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the receiving party is the User, it shall be sent to one or both of
			the following addresses: (i) the last billing address you used, (ii)
			your shipping address (if available).
		</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		In the event that Oops does not have either of the above addresses for a
		User, Oops may (but is not obligated to) try and message you using any
		means of communication you provided and ask for your mailing address.
		The 30 days response time shall be counted from the day in which Oops
		has sent you the message asking for your mailing address.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND
		OOPS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN
		A CLASS ACTION.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the event that an attempt to resolve a Dispute pursuant to the
		previous section is unsuccessful, you and Oops agree to resolve such
		Dispute by binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate Disputes
		includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the
		Site, the App, the Services or these Terms, whether based in contract,
		tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and
		regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of
		these Terms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the provisions in this section, nothing in these Terms will be
		deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party
		to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an
		enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local
		agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a
		court of law; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an
		intellectual property infringement claim.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any arbitration between you and Oops will be settled under the Federal
		Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution
		Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
		Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration
		Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be
		administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available
		online at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the
		AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Oops.
	</p>
	<p>
		A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice
		of the Dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal
		Express (signature required) (“Notice”) to the addresses of the parties
		as set forth in the “Dispute Resolution” section. The Notice must: (a)
		describe the nature and basis of the claim or Dispute; and (b) set forth
		the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith
		efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach
		an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you
		or Oops may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration,
		the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Oops must not be
		disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final
		decision and award, if any. If the Dispute is finally resolved through
		arbitration in your favor, Oops will pay you the highest of the
		following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the
		last written settlement amount offered by Oops in settlement of the
		Dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $100.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon
		in New York, New York, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may
		choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the
		basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a
		non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing
		as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your
		billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of
		your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought
		for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
		Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees
		will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse
		Oops for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your
		obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which
		the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned
		written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
		conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The
		arbitrator may make rulings and resolve Disputes as to the payment and
		reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and
		upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s
		ruling on the merits.
	</p>
	<p>
		YOU AND OOPS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
		YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER
		IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless
		both you and Oops agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate
		more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
		form of a representative or class proceeding.
	</p>
	<p>
		If Oops makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other
		than a change to our address for Notice, you may reject the change by
		sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Oops
		address for Notice, in which case your account with Oops (if you had
		one) will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as
		in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
	</p>
	<p>
		If any portion of this binding arbitration provision is found to be
		unenforceable, then the entirety of this section will be null and void
		and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and
		venue described in the “Governing Law” section will govern any action
		arising out of or related to these Terms. The arbitrator has exclusive
		authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation,
		applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration provision.
	</p>
	<p><strong>CHANGES</strong></p>
	<p>
		We may amend our Terms at any time by publishing revised Terms on our
		App or the Site and/or by sending an email to the address you gave us.
		These Terms are current as of the date first set forth above. If any
		changes are made to these Terms, we will post them on this page, so
		please be sure to check back periodically. If you continue to use the
		App, the Site or any other Services after those changes are in effect,
		you agree to the revised Terms. Therefore, it is important for you to
		periodically review our Terms to make sure you still agree to them. If
		you object to any such modifications, your sole recourse will be to
		cease using the Services, the App and the Site. Oops reserves the right
		to change any and all features of our Services, the App and the Site, at
		any time, without notice.
