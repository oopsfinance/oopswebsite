          <h3>Security and Storage of Information</h3>
          Oops takes the security of your Personal Information very seriously.
          We work hard to protect the Personal Information that you provide from
          loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, or disclosure. Oops uses
          Windows Information Protection (WIP); however, given the nature of
          communications and information processing technology, there is no
          guarantee that Personal Information will be absolutely safe from
          access, alteration, or destruction by a breach of any of our physical,
          technical, and managerial safeguards.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your
          device and account by, among other things, choosing a unique and
          complex password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and
          keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for
          any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your
          account via unauthorized password activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain the Personal Information we collect for so long as is
          reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data was
          collected, to perform our contractual and legal obligations, and for
          any applicable statute of limitations periods for the purposes of
          bringing and defending claims.

          <h3>Third-Party Links</h3>

          may also use third-party advertisers, ad networks, and other

          advertisements on our Site. Any access to and use of such linked
          websites and applications is not governed by this Policy but instead
          is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We do not
          endorse these parties, their content, or any products and services
          they offer. We are not responsible for the information practices of

          <h3>Users Outside the USA</h3>
          We host our App, Site Services, and any and all databases and servers
          in the United States. If you are an individual located in the European
          Union, the United Kingdom, Canada or another jurisdiction outside of

          States laws, you should not use our Site or Service or provide us with
          any of your information, whether Personal Information or otherwise.
          Please be aware that information we collect (including through the use
          of methods such as Cookies and other web technologies) will be
          processed and stored in the United States or in other countries where
          we or our third-party Service Providers have operations. By using Oops
          and submitting Personal Information, Users give their express consent
          to have it transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States
          or other jurisdictions which may not offer the same privacy
          protections available in your local jurisdiction or country of
          citizenship/residence.

          <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
          We do not support “Do Not Track” requests. To determine whether any of

          <h3>Notice to California Residents</h3>
          California laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act and the
          “Shine the Light” law, give California residents certain rights
          regarding use and disclosure of “personal information” (as defined
          under California law). Oops will comply with all relevant California
          privacy laws, and will not share a User’s “personal information” with
          third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Notice to Nevada Residents</h3>
          Nevada residents may have the right to opt out of the sale of
          “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration (as
          such terms are defined under Nevada law). While Oops does not engage
          in the practice of selling “personally identifiable information” for
          monetary consideration, Users may submit a request to Oops to opt out
          of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing us at
          hi@oops.finance. Oops will take reasonable steps to authenticate the
          identity of the User to verify the request, comply with the User’s opt
          out of sales request, and respond to such request.
